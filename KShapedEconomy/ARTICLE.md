**Headline:** The "Agency Squeeze": Why Service Businesses Are Dying While SaaS Booms.

**Body:**

There is a silent crisis happening in the B2B sector right now: **No one wants to spend on services, but everyone is buying software.
We are witnessing the most aggressive "K-Shaped" economy in history, but it’s not just about rich vs. poor. It’s about **Scalable Tech vs. Human Labor.**

Since the AI boom began in 2023, the market has bifurcated:
1.  **The Automated Ecosystem:** Big Tech & SaaS (XLK +137%, NVDA +1228%) are capturing all the value.
2.  **The Service Economy:** Agencies, consultants, and small businesses (IWM) are flatlining.

**Why is this happening?**
B2B acquisition has become brutally hard because the value proposition of "we do it for you" is losing to "this AI does it for $50/mo."

Companies are cutting service retainers to fund software subscriptions. They don't want to hire more people or outsource to more agencies; they want to build internal automated systems.

The chart below shows the reality: Capital is fleeing the "human-heavy" service sector and flooding into the "compute-heavy" automated sector.

The lesson for agency owners and service providers?
The middleman is being automated away. You can no longer just sell "hours" or "services." You must pivot to building **Automated Intellectual Property (AIP)** or productized outcomes.

Adapt your model, or get squeezed out by the software you refused to build.
